FLASK

	Flask is a web application framework written in Python. It represents a collection of libraries and modules that enables a web application developer to write applications easily without thinking about protocols.

We need to have python installed to use flask. Once you have python install flask using the following command.

# pip install Flask

We can use HTTP methods in Flask.	HTTP protocol is the foundation of data communication in world wide web. Different methods of data retrieval from specified URL are defined in this protocol. The methods are described down below.
# GET : Sends data in simple or unencrypted form to the server.
# HEAD : Sends data in simple or unencrypted form to the server without body.

# PUT : Replaces target resource with the updated content.
# DELETE : Deletes target resource provided as URL

By default, the Flask route responds to the GET requests. However, this can be altered by providing methods argument to route() decorator.
