FLASK

	Flask is a web application framework written in Python. It represents a collection of libraries and modules that enables a web application developer to write applications easily without thinking about protocols.

We need to have python installed to use flask. Once you have python install flask using the following command.

# pip install Flask

We can use HTTP methods in Flask.	HTTP protocol is the foundation of data communication in world wide web. Different methods of data retrieval from specified URL are defined in this protocol. The methods are described down below.

1	GET 	It is the most common method which can be used to send data in the unencrypted form to the server.

2 	HEAD 	It is similar to the GET but used without the response body.

3 	POST 	It is used to send the form data to the server. The server does not cache the data transmitted using the post method.

4 	PUT 	It is used to replace all the current representation of the target resource with the uploaded content.

5 	DELETE 	It is used to delete all the current representation of the target resource specified in the URL.


By default, the Flask route responds to the GET requests. However, this can be altered by providing methods argument to route() decorator.
